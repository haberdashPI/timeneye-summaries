Now that I have some of the basics of django worked out, I need
to get to the point where I can make a simple query to timeneye

we now have the ability to get an access token
next step is to have the authorization page redirect
to a paritcular view

the first view I want to make should just show the percentages for
each phase category in the past week & month

next step would be to compare these percentages to some ideal levels

once that it is working well, show the times that I last worked
on each project in my list of prioritized projects

organize them by priority on the basis of a weight etc... as
in my google sheet format
